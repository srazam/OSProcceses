## Purpose of the Program 
Creating an echo server in which echos back what it receives from the client.  

> [!TIP]
> Make sure that the server and client are in the same directory and your terminal also reflects that 

## Compile and run the server: 
First compile the server: javac Server.java 

Then run it: java Server 

## Compile and run the client: 
Next, compile the client: javac Client.java

## To exit the program: 
Input “Exit” into the client side and hit return. Both the client and the server should exit.  

## Example result:
