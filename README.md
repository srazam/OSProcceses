# Operating Systems - Processes

This assignment was for our Operating System course where each program focused on different processes. These were the following questions:
- Question 2: Forking a child process until it becomes a zombie process and will stay in the system for about 15 seconds.
- Question 3: Creating a sequence with the following operations within the child process after using a fork system call: if n is even, then n = n/2 but if n is odd, then n = 3*n + 1
- Question 4: Creating an echo server in which echos back what it receives from the client.
- Question 5: Sending a message through one pipe (from the first pipe to the second pipe), reversing the case of each letter in the message, then sending it back through a different pipe (back from the second pipe to the first process).
